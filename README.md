## Abstract

> The Refined Power Analysis, Zero-Value Point, and Exceptional Procedure 
> attacks introduced side-channel attack techniques against
> specific cases of elliptic curve cryptography. The three attacks recover
> bits of a static ECDH key adaptively, collecting information on whether
> a certain multiple of the input point was computed. We unify and generalize
> these attacks in a common framework, and solve the corresponding
> problem for a broader class of inputs. We also introduce a version of
> the attack against windowed scalar multiplication methods, recovering
> the full scalar instead of just a part of it. Finally, we systematically
> analyze elliptic curve point addition formulas from the Explicit-Formulas
> Database, classify all non-trivial exceptional points, and find them
> in new formulas. These results indicate the usefulness of our tooling for
> unrolling formulas and finding special points, potentially of independent
> research interest.
